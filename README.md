## Overview

The Video Surveillance System is an advanced AI-powered Android application designed to enhance safety by detecting violent or suspicious activities in real time. This system provides alerts and evidence of anomalies, such as fire, fighting, and road accidents, to authorized users. It is specifically engineered for environments where real-time monitoring and rapid response are crucial.
